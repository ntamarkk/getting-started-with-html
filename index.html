<b>The Basics of the Web and HTML</b>
<br>
<br>
<p>The <b><em>World Wide Web</em></b> is a collection of text documents written in a language called <b><em>HTML</em></b> which stands for Hypertext Markup<br>
Language. HTML is the basis of every web page and it binds together different types of files such as plain text, HTML,<br>
images, videos and music.</p>
<p>A <b><em>browser</em></b> for example Microsoft Internet Explorer makes requests via the <b><em>internet</em></b> to <b><em>servers</em></b> by communicating using a protocol<br>
called <b><em>HTTP.</em></b> The servers respond with files that your browser displays.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b></p>
<p>HTML documents lie at the heart of the web and is made up of the follwing;<br>
<br>
- Plain text<br>
- Markup or tags<br>
- Images, videos and music as examples<br>
- Links to other pages
</p>
<p><b>HTML Tags</b></p>
<P>The structure of an HTML tag looks like this <b>< NAME>Contents< /NAME></b></P>
<p>An entire HTML tag structure can also be referred to as an <b><em>element</em></b>. An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening<br>
and closing tags. Examples of HTML tags include;</p>
<p>< b> <b>bold</b><br>
< em> <em>emphasis</em> - makes things italic<br>
< a> anchor - uses an attribute and is for making links. please click on this link  <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> to access the Udacity homepage.<br>
< img> images - for including images<br>
< br> break - for creating line breaks<br>
< p> paragraph - another way of creating line breaks<br>
< div> division - used to group block elements for formatting<br> 
< form> form - used to create an HTML form for completion by a user</p>
<p>Some HTML tags are called <b><em>VOID tags</em></b> because they have no content and as such, they do not need a closing tag. Examples of <br>
void tags are < br> break and < img> images.</p>
<p><b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b> Elements</p>
<p><b><em>Inline</b></em> elements just create a new line and examples include bold, emphasis, images, break, anchor, span and strong. on the other<br>
hand <b><em>Block</b></em> elements create an invisible box (which can have height and width) around text. Examples include paragraph,<br>
division and form.</p>
<p><b>Container</b> Elements</p>
<p><b><em>Container</b></em> elements only contain their elements. However, styles can be attached to them which affects how they are displayed.<br>
Examples include span and division. They are both similar in that they can have content but a difference lies in the fact that<br>
span is an inline element whereas division is a block element.</p>
